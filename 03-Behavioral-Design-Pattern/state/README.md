# **State Design Pattern**

## **Type**

Behavioral Design Patterns, like the State Pattern, focus on efficient communication and responsibility distribution among objects. They are pivotal in managing the internal state of an object and its interactions with other objects, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of code. This category includes patterns like State, Observer, Strategy, and Command.

## **Definitions**

### **Context:**

The Context is a central component in the State pattern. It defines the interface of interest to clients and maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.

- Context: The class that contains a state variable that references the current state. The context delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object.

### **State Interface:**

This interface defines a common interface for all concrete state classes. It declares methods which the context (and other states) will call to trigger state transitions.

- State Interface: An interface or abstract class that declares methods for performing state-specific behavior.

### **Concrete States:**

These are classes that implement the State interface and provide the actual behavior corresponding to a state of the Context.

- OnState and OffState: Examples of concrete states. OnState might represent a system being "on" and define behavior accordingly, while OffState would represent it being "off".

## **Descriptions**

When to use:

- When an object's behavior changes based on its internal state, and you want to avoid large conditional statements (like switch/case) in the object's methods.
- If the number of states and transitions are numerous and managing them is complex.
- When the state-specific behavior and state transition logic are subject to changes and extensions.

Pros:

- Encapsulates state-specific behavior and transitions, making additions and modifications more manageable.
- Simplifies the code of the context by eliminating bulky state conditional logic.
- Each state can be independently designed and tested, promoting maintainability and testability.

Cons:

- If a system has only a few states or doesn't change states frequently, implementing the State pattern can be an overkill.
- The number of classes increases as new states are added, potentially leading to a proliferation of classes.
- It still need parsing to get the current state of the context, and might introduce bugs when state switching edge cases hasn't been handled correctly

The State Pattern provides a robust and flexible structure for managing state-related behavior in a system, enhancing code maintainability and extensibility. It's particularly useful in complex systems where objects undergo frequent state transitions, and each state entails distinct behavior.
