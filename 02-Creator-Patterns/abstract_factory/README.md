# Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented. This pattern is about abstracting the creation process of objects in a way that the client doesn't need to know about the actual concrete implementations.

## Type

Creator Design Patterns provide interfaces for creating objects, ensuring that concrete classes are separated from the code that uses them. They promote flexibility, encapsulation, and loose coupling. Common examples include Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Builder patterns.

## Definitions

### Abstract Factory:

This is an interface that declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.

### Concrete Factory:

These are specific classes that implement the abstract factory interface to create concrete products. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant or family of products.

### Abstract Product:

This is an interface for a type of product object.

### Concrete Product:

These are the individual classes that implement the abstract product interface. Concrete products are created by corresponding concrete factories.

### Client:

The client uses interfaces declared by the abstract factory and abstract product classes. The client is independent of how the products it uses are created.

## Example

Consider a UI toolkit with two themes, "Dark" and "Light". Each theme has different styles for buttons, text fields, etc.

Abstract Factory: UIThemeFactory with methods like createButton() and createTextField().
Concrete Factory: DarkThemeFactory and LightThemeFactory implementing UIThemeFactory.
Abstract Product: Interfaces like Button and TextField.
Concrete Product: Implementations like DarkButton, LightButton, DarkTextField, and LightTextField.
Client: Uses UIThemeFactory to create UI elements, unaware of the concrete classes.

## Descriptions

When to use:

- Consistency Among Products: When products in a family are designed to be used together and you need to enforce this constraint in your system. The Abstract Factory pattern ensures that objects that share a common theme or concept are used together.

- Extension Point for Libraries and Frameworks: When developing libraries or frameworks, the Abstract Factory pattern provides an excellent way to allow users to extend or modify its standard components.

Pros:

- Flexibility in Object Creation: It allows for the creation of objects without specifying their exact types. This flexibility is particularly useful when the system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of products.

- Encouragement of Consistency: Ensures consistency among products created by a factory. If products designed to work together are created using the same factory, they are compatible by default.

- Decoupling Code: Reduces tight coupling between classes by centralizing the creation of objects. Clients deal only with interfaces rather than concrete implementations, which promotes loose coupling.

Cons:

- Increased Complexity: Introduces several new layers and interfaces, which can complicate the codebase, especially in scenarios where such a level of abstraction is not necessary.

- Difficulties in Extending Product Families: Adding new kinds of products can be challenging since the Abstract Factory and all its subclasses might need to be altered, potentially violating the Open/Closed Principle.

- Fixed Product Set Limitation: The pattern usually works with a predetermined set of products. Extending this set can be cumbersome and may require significant refactoring.

- Obscured Dependencies: Relationships between different products and factories can become less transparent due to the abstraction, making the system harder to understand for new developers.

- Potential for Overhead: The extra layers of abstraction can introduce overhead, both in terms of performance and code manageability, particularly in simpler systems where such a sophisticated approach isn't warranted.

- Initial Setup Overhead: Setting up an Abstract Factory pattern can be more laborious compared to direct object creation, due to the need for defining specific interfaces and classes for factories and products.
