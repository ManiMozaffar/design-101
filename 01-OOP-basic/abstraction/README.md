In object-oriented programming (OOP), the digital entities you create are often inspired by objects or concepts from the real world. However, it's important to remember that these programmatic representations aren't intended to be exact replicas. Rather, they encapsulate only the characteristics and actions that are pertinent to the specific problem you're trying to solve, while disregarding irrelevant details.

For instance, imagine a "Car" class in a racing game compared to one in a ride-sharing app. In the racing game, you'd focus on attributes like speed, tire condition, and fuel level. In contrast, the ride-sharing app would emphasize data like passenger capacity, current location, and availability.

This selective representation of real-world objects or concepts, constrained by the needs of the situation, is known as "abstraction." It allows you to focus only on the attributes and behaviors crucial to your specific use-case while omitting unnecessary details.

# New Example
Let's consider a "Book" class but in two different contexts: a digital library system and a retail bookstore application.
In a digital library system, the "Book" class may include:

```
Title
Author
Number of Pages
Current Reader
Time Left to Return
```


In a retail bookstore application, the same "Book" class would look very different, perhaps like this:
```
Title
Author
Price
Stock Availability
ISBN
```

Here, although the real-world object is the same (a book), the programmatic representation changes based on the context. This exemplifies abstraction in OOP.
