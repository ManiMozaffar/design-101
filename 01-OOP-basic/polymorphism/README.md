Polymorphism is like a talent show where every participant can perform, but the type of performance—be it singing, dancing, or juggling—varies. Even though each performer adheres to the general structure of "performing," the specifics are unique to each.

In programming, polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types and classes. It's like having a list of "performers," without knowing their specialized talent. When the spotlight turns on them, they'll perform their unique acts.

Here, each object in the vehicles list knows how to respond to the move() method, but does so in a way that's appropriate for its specific type. You don't need to know what type of Vehicle you're dealing with; you just know that calling move() will yield the right kind of motion for that vehicle.

Polymorphism is thus the capability of a program to use the correct method for an object, even when the precise type of the object is unknown. This allows objects to interact in a system designed for their parent class, yet behave in a manner consistent with their specialized subclass.
